# Two pointers

- Contraint based Movement strategy:
    Control two position and move them based on what information they give instead of checking all combo

## Problem it solves

You are standing at two positions in an array and you are allowed to move only one step at a time.
Each move must eliminate some wrong possibilities.

## One condition that makes TWO Pointers work - ORDER

- Sorted array/ A direction (left->right)/ Sometimes that grows/shrinks predictably
- If there is no order, Two pointers usually doesn't work.
