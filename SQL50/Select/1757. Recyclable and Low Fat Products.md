## Problem #1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topic:** Select 

**Problem Description:**  
Given a Table called Products with columns - `product_id`, `low_fats`, `recyclable`. 
Where low_fats and recyclable are ENUM :
- low_fats -> 'Y'=Yes, 'N'=No
- recyclable -> 'Y'=Yes, 'N'=No

**We need to display `product_id` of products which has `low_fats` as well as `recyclable`**

---

### Approach / Thought Process:
- As we need to display => use `SELECT`
- Filter for low_fats and recyclable => use `WHERE`
- Both conditions should be *True* => use `AND`

---

### Solution (SQL):
```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
